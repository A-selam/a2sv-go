[![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Go-blue?logo=go)](https://golang.org)
[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-In%20Progress-yellow)]()

A simple console-based Library Management System built in Go as part of an internship learning project.

This system demonstrates foundational Go concepts including:

- Interfaces
- Struct composition
- Maps and slices
- Method receivers
- Clean modular architecture
- Console input/output with `bufio.Reader`

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies & Concepts

- âœ… Structs and custom types
- âœ… Interfaces and method implementation
- âœ… Maps and slices for in-memory storage
- âœ… Auto-incrementing ID generators
- âœ… Terminal input/output with `fmt` and `bufio`
- âœ… Separation of concerns (Controller â†” Service â†” Models)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Make sure Go is installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/A-selam/a2sv-go.git
cd a2sv-go/library_management/

# Run the application
go run main.go
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This system is in-memory only â€” data resets each time the app restarts.
- Designed for learning purposes â€” not production-grade.
- Modular structure makes it easy to expand with file/database persistence later.

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements

Built as part of the Go track in the A2SV internship learning phase. Inspired by practical system design exercises for learning backend fundamentals.
